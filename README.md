# Productive Programmer
Placeholder for my thoughts on being a productive programmer. I am not saying these are the best possible ways, but, these are my preferences that I think makes me productive. Other developers can have different preferences than mine. 

Follow Agile Practices: 
* Keep Scrum as small as possible. Answer only 3 questions and discuss nothing more
 * What did I accomplish yesterday
 * What will I work on today
 * Any blockers?

Choosing a favorite IDE depending on languages/context
* VSCode - Plugins are really useful and inbuilt commant tool terminal. 
* Brackets - (I don't prefer brackets now and switched to VSCode/Intellij) 
  Earlier Reasosns for using Brackets - front end development -  I have tried other tools like Sublime and Atom for a brief period of time and chose to stay with Brackets. Mostly because closes html tags automatically, and autocompletion for javascript/css. Autocompletion exists in other tools as well but I like the Brackets' way of autocompleting html tags.  Haven't had the chance to explore VSCode(Visual Studio Code) yet.
* Intellij IDEA - full-stack developement (Java/Front end)/in-built command line tool/auto refresh from disk/version control integration/easier version control diff/faster than eclipse/Gradle Support/server launcher for fronend dev/
  Ctrl + q For viewing quick documentation. 
  Integration With Git is really useful. 
* Eclipse - (not really using Eclipse now as I have found myself to be more productive in Intellij) 
      Current Reasons - I think eclipse helps writing JUnit test cases. You can right click on a class and generate unit test cases for all the methods (although in TDD test cases are supposed to be written first). Eclipse way of showing quick documentation is really helpful compared to that of Intellij. 
      Earlier Reasons to use Eclipse - Java Developement/Easier configuration of servers such as Apache, JBoss/runnable programs/version control plugins/Navigator and Package Manager view/search functions/slower than Intellij/l/ocal remote debugging/refactoring wizard/PMD/Find Bugs/Sonar Integration/Classpath and Compiler configuration/
* Visual studio - for C# and ASP.NET MVC application development. It comes in-built with Azure deployment facilities and great to use if you plan to deploy on Microsoft Azure. It is great for Windows development using WPF and WinForms. Default integration with Git.  
* Notepad++ General purpose text editor - Syntax highlighting for most languages supported. It was my favorite Editor once. Now have almost stopped using it. 
* Text pad - Text search/find and replace/block text selection 
* Microsoft Excel - Basic analytics/shortcuts for navigating through and selecting and manipulating excel data/Tables - formatting, sort, filter/Text to columns/Remove Duplicates/Cell formatting/Charts/Formulas/Pivot Tables/Macro programming/ Conditional Formatting
* MS Powerpoint/ https://prezi.com/ https://www.powtoon.com/ : For presentaion. MS Powerpoint is well known and de-facto standard. Prezi, however has some visual effects which appealed to me. And Powtoon are great for creating animated presentations and can convey ideas easily and can deliver same message in a more powerful manner compared to other two formats. 
* Version Control Softwares :- git/svn - familiarity and hands on with following actions add/update/checkout/commit/resolve conflicts/merge
* Git Bash - Git command line tool. I am comfortable using unix commands over windows and it has improved my productivity significantly
* Cloud accounts - Google Drive as it comes with their own version of document/spreadsheet and slides editor. They are really great when concurrent users are editing it. Syncing with mobile is easy well. If you have a gmail account, you can easily save items from your email to cloud and organize them in the way you want. https://paper.dropbox.com has good features when it comes to creating and editing online documents. It also has simple UI and convincing usage and doesn't really cause much problems.  
* Unix - aware of commands Listed below - usage of vi editor
* Outlook - Rules creation/Email organization for Noise reduction/Search Folders/Archive Emails/Flag Messages/Appointments/Reminders/Conversation by Date
* Chrome - Developer Tools/Bookmark Manager/Ad Blocker/Postman for mocking http requests/Print to PDF
* Google Drive - Document Storage/Online Editing using Google Docs/Google Sheets
* Sharepoint - Workflows/File Permissions/Versioning/Forms
* Jira - Agile Sprint Dashboards/Stories/Kanban Dashboards/Filters Sort per project or individual/Advanced query JQL/Navigation pane configuration/Swimlanes/
* Crucible - Code Review Tool/Inline commenting/File level comments/Split screen diff/Unified Diff
* Content management system - Confluence/Wiki/Paperbox dropbox/wordpress
* Gradle - Build tasks automation
* Shell Scripting - Server side tasks automation 
* Jmeter - Performance testing for your application/services
* DBMS Tools - Aqua Data Studio/SQL Database Studio for SQL syntax highlighting/formatting/Import or Export Data/SQL History/In Memory Filtering sort and search/Export To Excel CSV/
* Rubber Duck Debugging
* Internet Download Manager - Increased download speed/Pause and Resume functionality/Avoids Duplicate Download/Easy when you want to save consecutive downloads in the same page/Download Videos. I purchased a version after using free trial for a month as I could not resist the usage of it
* Greenshot - Tool to capture screenshots and it has been purely built keeping productivity in mind
